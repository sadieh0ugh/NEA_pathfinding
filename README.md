Computer Science NEA 

Repository for holding my Computer Science NEA 2019/2020.

My system focuses on educating prospective Computer Science students on the principals of graph traversal through a maze game.
The purpose of my game is to get to the end of the maze before the algorithm which is automatically completing the maze in the 
background.
I plan to implement the following algorithms and explain their functionalities: Djikstra, A* and Breadth First Search, as they are 
commonly studied at an A Level standard.
