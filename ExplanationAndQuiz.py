textAlgorithm1 = "1. Firstly, the starting square of the maze (here the top left) is chosen.\n"

textAlgorithm4 = "4. This process is repeated until a square with no possible neighbours is found.\n\n"
textAlgorithm5 = "5. Then the algorithm traces back to the previous square to check for available neighbours.\n\n"
textalgorithm6 = "6. Finally, the maze is completely formed when all the squares have no valid neighbours.\n\n" \
